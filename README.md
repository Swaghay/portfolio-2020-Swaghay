## About Me
My name is Abhay Upadhyaya and this is my programming portfolio. Ever since I was young I always wanted to be able to make videogames and as I got older I realized my dream by starting programming. In 2018 I took AP Computer Science Principals where I learned the basics of programming in a block-based language called MIT App Inventor. In 2018 I also joined the EPHS programming club where I started to learn the basics of C, this was my first foray into a text-based programming language. Then in 2019 I took AP Java where I applied what I learned in AP Computer Science Principals into Java and I learned the basics of Java, I applied all of my learning in my end of the year project in which I made Tic-Tac-Toe. Then this year I am taking Ios Mobile App Development where I am learning Swift and am programming Ios apps. I am also taking Cyber Security where I have learned a little bit of HTML and I am making basic websites.

## Experience

HTML (Since 2020)

## Projects
[CalculatorC](https://github.com/Swaghay/CalculatorC): This is the first programming project that I ever made in a text-based programming language as opposed to a block-based programming language like MIT App Inventor. It is a text-based calculator that can do simple addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. I made this using what I learned from the EPHS programming club.

[Pong](https://github.com/Swaghay/Pong): This is the final app that I made in MIT app inventor. This is a reimagining of the "original" videogame Pong but it is single-player and has a lot of extra features. This app sums up everything that I learned in AP Computer Science Principals. It includes all of the fundamentals of programming from data values to complex algorithms.

[You-Lost](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-java-masterminds): This was the final project that I did in AP Java, I worked on this in a group of 4 people. It is a pretty basic Java version of tic tac toe using the Swing GUI widget tool kit, but it does include a fairly difficult bot. This project sums up most of my Java knowledge that I learned in AP Java. Since this project, I have learned some more Java, primarily in Android Studio. 

[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Swaghay/Tic-Tac-Toe): This is the first app that I made by myself in Swift. It is built in the new SwiftUI framework. It is a basic 2 player tic tac toe app. I wanted to make this app to see the difficult difference between Java and Swift. What I learned was that Swift is a lot easier to pick up than Java.

[Wack A Mole](https://github.com/Swaghay/WackAMole): This is the second app that I made by myself in Swift, this is a simple digital version of the arcade wack a mole machines with a timer. I learned a lot about SwiftUI when making this. This was the first app that I put in TestFlight so I got some experience with how publishing an app works.

[Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra): This is the first app where I am working in a group to make an app in Swift. It is going to be a game made in the SpriteKit framework. I am learning a lot about how you make an app with my group from making art to programming. I have learned that SpriteKit is a lot harder than SwiftUI.
